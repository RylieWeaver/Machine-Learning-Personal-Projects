# NLP Project: Customer Service Ticket Subject Classifier

## Description
In this project, I focused on classifying customer service ticket subjects based on descriptions provided by customers. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, I developed a transformer model by tweaking the base BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) large language model to accurately determine the subject of customer inquiries.

## My Role
As the sole member involved in this personal project, I managed the entire process from start to finish, which included:

- Preprocessing and analyzing the customer service dataset.
- Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text data analysis.
- Developing methods to optimize the model's performance within the constraints of limited computational resources.
- Developing and fine-tuning a classification model using BERT.
- Evaluating the model's performance and iteratively improving its accuracy.

## Technologies and Methodologies
The project utilized a range of technologies and methodologies, including:

- **Python**: For data processing and model implementation.
- **Transfer Learning**: Using BERT tokenizer and sequence classification models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- **Accelerate Library**: For efficient model training and evaluation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand dataset characteristics.

## Project Outcomes
Despite the challenges of large computational cost and complex customer inquiries, the project achieved:

- Successful implementation of a BERT-based classifier to determine ticket subjects.
- A foundation for further development and refinement of the model in ticket subject classification.
